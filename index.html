                <div class="about-details">
                    <p>A novel called Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (written by the anonymous author tls123) has been written and published over the course of a decade, and Kim Dokja is the sole reader who has followed it to its ending. When the real world is plunged into the premise of Ways of Survival, Kim Dokja's unique knowledge of the novel becomes vital to his survival. Kim Dokja allies with Yoo Joonghyuk, the protagonist of Ways of Survival, in order to change the novel's original plot and more quickly approach the end of the story. As Kim Dokja and his party members progress through the scenarios, they face increasingly difficult threats and life-or-death challenges, struggling to stay alive and work together as they aim to destroy the <Star Stream> that demands their suffering.</p>

                <div class="about-details">
                    <p>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint was originally published as a webnovel. The novel is divided into 5 volumes, each containing a number of episodes, along with a 5-part epilogue. Each episode is further divided into around 4–8 chapters. The novel was exceedingly popular in the Korean webnovel reader community, having exceeded 26 million views on Munpia by September 2019.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="title">Other Versions</h2>
                <div class="about-details">
                    <p>In January 2021, an ebook and physical book release were both announced. The first eight ebook volumes were released in March 2021 on Munpia and later Naver. Four more were released in September 2021. The last volumes appeared in January 2023. Sing Shong have confirmed that they revised some parts of the novel for the ebook, but those changes will not be reflected in the contents of the original webnovel. According to the "author's review" featured in the e-book, both versions are equally "correct" and likened to conflicting memories of the same events. The ebook has been receiving various physical releases. Since 2022, Korean softcover and hardcover editions are being published. Official translations in simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, and Thai, are distributed as well.</p>

                <div class="about-details">
                    <p>The side stories are bonus chapters, detailing previously untold events in ORV (e.g. expanding on Yoo Joonghyuk's backstory). As of May 2023, five side stories have been released: two in the ebook, one in the physical hardcover release and one freely available on Munpia/Naver. The last side story began on February 15th 2023 and has been ongoing ever since with roughly four new chapters a week. It appears to be a direct continuation of ORV and is centered around webnovel author Lee Hakhyun. Furthermore, ORV characters have made an appearance in the side story of World After The Fall, one of Sing Shong's other webnovels. None of this content has been officially translated in English yet.</p>
